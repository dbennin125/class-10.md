# Errors
 Errors happen and it's up to you to find them and fix them. Often times errors can be something simple like mispelling or not putting a bracket on an array but other times it is more complicated. For more complicated matters, console.log is a great tool as well as debugging. You can also use the console in your browser to help you find mistakes. Sometimes when you find a bug, you will need to fix it by using the catch, throw, finally statements to write code for possible problems(future proofing). I found out about the console.assert where you feed it the wrong info to force a false stament. I also experienced a NaN error yesterday which made me think of this chapter. The chapter was helpful because errors will happen and you need tools to fix them. I think about class and following the bouncing ball. That method, idea works best for me.
